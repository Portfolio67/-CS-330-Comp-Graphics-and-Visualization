OpenGL C++ , making a 3D scene with camera and lights


I learned new skills of computer graphics and how to compile mesh frameworks from a vertex array.ã€€I also learned how to make different objects in the map picture coordinates to that object.   This project the use of the pipeline shaders was difficult to overcome. But using the approach of understanding each piece of code and applying C++ syntax to the code to accomplish a task.  I took it each task at a time. I like the agile process of setting out with one task for that day. Then testing.  The iterative process was used a lot to build up in the the milestones for the final project. This was difficult for this project because I did not know how to do everything in OpenGL.   The big picture was hard for me to see. I tried many different approaches to make sure I tried every avenue and found the best object oriented principle-based solution.   Learning C++ an open GL is a great way for me to get better skills and coding. I could also use this in my professional career for building animations for websites or games.  Other programs are based off of OpenGl so this was a great one to use for professional use in the future.
